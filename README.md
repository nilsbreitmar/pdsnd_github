## Udacity Nanodegree for Data Science: Bikeshare

### Date created: 12 July 2019

### Description
In order to fullfill the Nanodegree from Udacity one project was to work on Bikeshare data and anlysis it with python.

The programm lets you filter by one of three cities which are:
- Chicago
- New York
- Washington

You then have the choice of also filtering by a month (date range from January - June) or select all and to filter by a weekday. The input can be either the fully written word or a 3 letter acronym.

At the end you can also display raw data if you want to do that.

### Files used

- bikeshare.py

- chicago.csv

- new_york_city.csv

- washngton.csv

### Credits
To my mentor **Ronak M.** who reviewed my code with me and gave me good suggestions how to attempt certain problems.
